# object-detection using custom filtering over the outputs of YOLOv2 model.


YOLOv2 (You only look once) is one of the most popular algorithm for object detection. As the name implies, the predictions of objects, and their bounding boxes are calculated as a single forward pass through the convolutional neural networks, making it suitable for **real time** object detection.
